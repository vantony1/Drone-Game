Few things to keep in mind while running the submitted program.

The drone moves in the following method: 
* left and right change angle to make the drone move left and right 
* up and down increase the speed and actually make the drone move
	â€” this is slightly not firendly to user by was a project requirement

To shoot press bar

When the drone shoots down an enemy drone you gain points
When the drone reaches the red landing zone at the end of the cave you gain points
When the drone physically hits a star, it gains points

When the drone physically hits the falling rocks or an enemy drone, it destroys the
other but loses a life
When the drone physically hits the stationary rocks, it loses fuel
When the drone lands to fast on the cave, dependent on the speed, it either dies fully or loses a life

Nothing happens when the drone hit the top roof;

Info about lives, levels, and fuel is displayed always on the top

Each level progressively gets harder by implementing more obstacles and more aggressive drones; but 
Player can gain more points
